Motivation & Expectations
Motivation:
I am passionate about the application of artificial intelligence in surveillance systems. I aim to build a system that can detect potentially dangerous behaviors in real time by combining deep learning models at different levels, thereby improving monitoring efficiency and public safety.
Expectations:
I expect to learn and apply cutting-edge techniques such as object detection, action recognition, and sequential modeling. I also look forward to gaining hands-on experience in data fusion and system integration. Ultimately, I plan to develop a prototype system with real-world application value.
Learning Outcomes and Experience Sharing
Learned how to leverage cloud platforms (Google Colab) for deep learning model training and inference.
Gained in-depth knowledge of the UCF-Crime and AVA datasets, understanding their characteristics and differences, as well as mastering data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.
Experienced the challenges and rewards of integrating multiple modules, learning to coordinate video-level anomaly detection with person-level action recognition for real-time surveillance.
Acquired valuable feedback through performance evaluation and real-case testing, which further enhanced our ability to fine-tune the models.
