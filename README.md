# Real-Time-Surveillance-and-Anomalous-Behavior-Recognition-System
I am passionate about the application of artificial intelligence in surveillance systems. I aim to build a system that can detect potentially dangerous behaviors in real time by combining deep learning models at different levels, thereby improving monitoring efficiency and public safety.

expectations:I expect to learn and apply cutting-edge techniques such as object detection, action recognition, and sequential modeling. I also look forward to gaining hands-on experience in data fusion and system integration. Ultimately, I plan to develop a prototype system with real-world application value.
