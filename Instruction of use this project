               Instruction of use this project 

###001-Please reach out to the website of Kaggle to download UCF-crime(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/odins0n/ucf-crime-dataset)
###002-Download all the AVA datasets that I provided on my GitHub.
###003-Please choose either cloud- or computer-based to do it (I highly suggest that you use it from your computer because in the end you have to deploy it and test it). 
###004-And start with either the AVA  or UCF crime dataset.
###005-After finishing both of them, you need to combine two of them. 
###006-In the end, please use different approach to see performance of models 





That’s the main concept of doing both different datasets. 
As my personal experience, I don’t suggest you use this one for any purpose because it can be much more complex and time-consuming. GOOD LUCK
